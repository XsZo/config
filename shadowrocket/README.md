**NOT SUPPORTED NOW**

This config is for [ShadowRocket](https://apps.apple.com/app/shadowrocket/id932747118), an iOS app.

I donnot recommend using this application, as it's buggy with awful ux.

To save trouble updating rules, I seperated one complete config into two files, `base.conf` and `profile.conf`, and you need to download both and select `profile.conf`. The `base.conf` contains the main part of config, such as rules, dns; while `profile.conf` contains all the customizable part of config, like route groups, and you may modify group in `profile.conf` by clicking on the 'i' icon beside and choose groups. When sections like dns get updated, one can save effort reconfiguring customized area by updating only `base.conf`.

When using proxy mode, there's no need to deal with config files, all the traffic are routed to proxy selected from homepage.

These files become not useable because shadowrocket-style rules are not generated.
